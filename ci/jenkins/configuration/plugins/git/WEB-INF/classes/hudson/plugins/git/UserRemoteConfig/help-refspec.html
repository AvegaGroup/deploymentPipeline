    A refspec controls the remote refs to be retrieved and how they map to local refs. If left blank, it will default to
    the normal behaviour of <tt>git fetch</tt>, which retrieves all the branch heads as <tt>remotes/REPOSITORYNAME/BRANCHNAME</tt>.
    This default behaviour is OK for most cases.

    <p>
    In other words, the default refspec is "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/REPOSITORYNAME/*" where <tt>REPOSITORYNAME</tt> is the value
    you specify in the above "name of repository" textbox.

    <p>
    When do you want to modify this value? A good example is when you want to just retrieve one branch. For example,
    <tt>+refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master</tt> would only retrieve the master branch and nothing else.
