<div>
  Specify the branches if you'd like to track a specific branch in a repository. If left blank, all branches will be examined for changes and built.

  The syntax is of the form: <tt>REPOSITORYNAME/BRANCH</tt>.
  In addition, <tt>BRANCH</tt> is recognized as a shorthand of <tt>*/BRANCH</tt>, '*' is recognized as a wildcard,
  and '**' is recognized as wildcard that includes the separator '/'. Therefore, <tt>origin/branches*</tt> would
  match <tt>origin/branches-foo</tt> but not <tt>origin/branches/foo</tt>, while <tt>origin/branches**</tt> would
  match both <tt>origin/branches-foo</tt> and <tt>origin/branches/foo</tt>.
