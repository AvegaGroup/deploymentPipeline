        Don't let Jenkins talk to GitHub and manage post commit hook URLs, and opt to do it manually.
        In this mode, in addition to configure projects with "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub",
        you need to ensure that Jenkins gets a POST to its <tt><a href="${rootURL}/github-webhook/">${app.rootUrl}github-webhook/</a></tt>
