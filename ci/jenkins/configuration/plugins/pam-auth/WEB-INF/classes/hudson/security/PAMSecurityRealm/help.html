  Delegates the authentication to the underlying Unix operating system user database.
  With this setting, users will be logged into Jenkins by entering their Unix username
  and password.

  <p>
  This mode will also allow you to use Unix groups for authorization. For example,
  you can say "everyone in the 'developers' group will have the administrator access".

  <p>
  Unix allows an user and a group to have the same name. If you need to disambiguate,
  you can use the '@' prefix to force the name to be interpreted as a group. For example,
  '@dev' would mean the 'dev' group and not the 'dev' user, while 'dev' would be interpreted
  as an user if you indeed have the user of that name.

  <p>
  This is done through a library called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_Authentication_Modules">PAM</a>,
  which defines its own configuration mechanism. 
  It also works correctly with user database extensions like
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Information_Service">NIS</a>.
