<div>
  If set, Jenkins ignores svn-property only changes of directories.
  These changes are ignored when determining whether a build should be triggered and are removed from a
  build's changeset.
  Main usage of this property is to ignore svn:mergeinfo changes (which would otherwise e.g. lead to a complete rebuild
  of a maven project, in spite of incremental build option).
